This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

It is a ChatGPT clone called AdiGPT. This is my first app with NextJS, Tailwind CSS and the OpenAI API. It uses React for the frontend and the NextJS Pages API for its backend all in TypeScript.
